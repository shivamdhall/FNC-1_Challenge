# FNC-1 Challenge

This repository contains a full implementation of several machine learning algorithms that are trained on
the FNC-1 database for the news stance detection problem.

A number of features are generated from the data including lexical matching features, semantic embedding features based on sentence similarity,
and features based on language model representations of headline and article body pairs.

The machine learning models implemented are linear regressoin, logistic regression, random-forest calssification and a MLP neural network.

The FNC-1 dataset can be downloaded from https://github.com/FakeNewsChallenge/fnc-1
